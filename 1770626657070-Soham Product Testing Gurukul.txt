READ THIS FIRST (MANDATORY)
You are no longer testing code in isolation.
You are now testing the product as a living system.
This task is about:
• Discovering where Gurukul breaks under real usage
• Identifying demo risks before an external observer does
• Hardening behavior on free-tier infra constraints
• Eliminating anything that feels “unfinished” or “fragile”
You are NOT:
• Adding new features
• Refactoring architecture
• Changing product scope
You ARE:
• Acting as the first hostile user, investor, school admin, and auditor
combined
⸻
INTEGRATION BLOCK
You will coordinate lightly with:
• Yashika — Backend / Deployments — confirm backend failure
behaviors
• Rukayya — PRANA / Guardrails — validate non-invasive telemetry
+ safety posture
• Vinayak — QA / Validation — cross-check reproducibility of issues
No blocking dependencies. You own this task.

DAY-BY-DAY BREAKDOWN
DAY 1 — Product Stress & Breakpoint Discovery
Scope:
Test Gurukul exactly as an external user would.
You must test:
• Student flows (login → subject → lesson → chat → quiz →
reflection)
• Teacher dashboards
• Admin dashboards
• EMS integration points
• Multilingual flows (at least 2 languages)
• TTS playback under slow network
• Backend cold starts (Render wake-ups)
• Vercel frontend behavior under refresh, route jumps, idle time
Explicitly test:
• Free-tier timeouts
• Inactive buttons
• Broken routes
• Silent failures
• Loading states that never resolve
• Auth edge cases (expired token, refresh, logout/login loops)
Deliverables:
• breakpoints_report.md
• dead_links_and_ui_risks.md
• infra_constraint_findings.md
⸻

DAY .5 — Demo Hardening & Guardrail Alignment
Scope:
Turn findings into demo-safe behavior, not feature work.
You must:
• Identify what must be hidden, disabled, or frozen for demo
• Propose safe fallback behaviors (do nothing gracefully)
• Align with existing demo_safety_profile.json and guardrails
• Validate that no crash or broken state is visible in demo paths
Also include:
• What works reliably even under stress
• What must NOT be shown in any public or investor demo
Deliverables:
• demo_safe_paths.md
• demo_exclusion_list.md
• failure_behavior_matrix.md
• final_demo_readiness_note.md

LEARNING KIT (MANDATORY)
Keywords:
• “Product stress testing SaaS free tier”
• “Demo hardening checklist startups”
• “UX failure modes under latency”
LLM Prompts:
• “List all ways a user can break a SaaS demo unintentionally”
• “What signals make a product feel unfinished during a demo?”
⸻
DELIVERABLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

• Markdown reports listed above
• Short screen recording (5–7 min):
– Showing real breakpoints
– Showing hardened flows
• Clear YES / NO on: “Is Gurukul demo-safe today?”
